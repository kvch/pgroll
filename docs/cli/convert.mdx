description: Convert SQL migration files to a pgroll migration
---

## Command

```
$ pgroll convert --name create_first_table /path/to/migration.sql
```

This reads the SQL statements from `/path/to/migration.sql` and translates them into a `pgroll` migration.
The name of the migration is going to be `create_first_table`.

### Read SQL statements from stdin with `pgroll convert`

If file name is not specified `pgroll convert` reads the SQL statements from stdin.

```
$ cat 'CREATE TABLE my_table(name text);' | pgroll convert --name create_first_table
```

<Warning>
The generated pgroll migrations might include `up` and `down` migrations. Those must be filled in manually because
right now pgroll cannot guess the correct up and down migrations.
</Warning>
