title: Writing up and down migrations
description: Guide to writing up and down migrations
---

In this guide, we will learn how to write `up` and `down` migrations in your `pgroll` operations. First, we are looking at how `up` and `down` migrations work. Then we will look at a few examples.

## What is an `up` and `down` migration of a `pgroll` operation?

Most `pgroll` migrations include `up` and `down` migrations. When `pgroll` migrates tables, it creates `up` and `down` triggers. The `up` triggers backfill the records in the table. The `down` triggers run during rollback.

The expressions in `up` and `down` are PL/pgSQL assignments executed by the triggers. Thus, these are evaluated as an SQL `SELECT` statement.

## Examples

Now let's look at a few examples. We are performing different migrations on this table:

```
postgres=# \d employee
                                 Table "public.employee"
 Column |       Type       | Collation | Nullable |               Default
--------+------------------+-----------+----------+--------------------------------------
 id     | integer          |           | not null | nextval('employee_id_seq'::regclass)
 name   | text             |           | not null |
 nick   | text             |           | not null |
 email  | text             |           |          |
 salary | double precision |           | not null |
 bio    | text             |           |          |
Indexes:
    "employee_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

```

With the following records:

```
 id | name  | nick |     email      | salary  |                 bio
----+-------+------+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------
  1 | Alice | al   | al@company.com |  5000.5 | hi, i am al
  2 | Bob   | rob  |                |  5400.5 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
  3 | Carol | cat  |                | 6500.75 |
```

### Keep the value

We are adding a new check constraint to the table to make sure all first names are capitalized. We inspected our table and know
that the check is on the application side.

```yaml
operations:
 - create_constraint:
    name: capitalized_name
    table: employee
    type: check
    columns:
     - name
    check: name = INITCAP(name)
    up:
     name: name
    down:
     name: name
```

Notice that both `up` and `down` migrations are set to `name` for `name` column. Thus, `pgroll` preserves the values in the column `name`.

So after the migraton, the table remains unchanged:

```
 name  | nick |     email      | salary  |                 bio
-------+------+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com |  5000.5 | hi, i am al
 Bob   | rob  |                |  5400.5 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  |                | 6500.75 |
```

### Convert type

In this example we are changing the type of a column from float to int.

Each person's salary is stored in a float. We are converting the `salary` column from float to integer.

```yaml
operations:
 - alter_column:
    table: employee
    column: salary
    type: integer
    up: trunc(salary)
    down: salary
```

After the migration, this is the contents of the table.

```
 name  | nick |     email      | salary |                 bio
-------+------+----------------+--------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com |   5000 | hi, i am al
 Bob   | rob  |                |   5400 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  |                |   6500 |
```

### Add a random value

We are adding a new column that cannot be null named `location`.

```yaml
operations:
 - add_column:
     table: employee
     up: '''New York'''
     column:
       name: location
       type: text
       nullable: false
```

The table is backfilled:

```
 id | nick |     email      |                 bio                 | name  | salary | location
----+------+----------------+-------------------------------------+-------+--------+----------
  1 | al   | al@company.com | hi, i am al                         | Alice |   5000 | New York
  2 | rob  |                | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening. | Bob   |   5400 | New York
  3 | cat  |                |                                     | Carol |   6500 | New York
```

### Add a placeholder value if it is null

We are adding a not null constraint to the `email` column. Any employee that does not have an email specified is automatically set the their default company email.

```yaml
operations:
 - alter_column:
    table: employee
    column: email
    nullable: false
    up: SELECT CASE WHEN email IS NULL THEN nick || '@company.com' ELSE email END
    down: email
```

After the migration is complete, everyone will have an email address:

```
 name  | nick |     email       | salary |                 bio
-------+------+-----------------+--------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com  |   5000 | hi, i am al
 Bob   | rob  | rob@company.com |   5400 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  | cat@company.com |   6500 |
```

### Backfill based on column value

Now let's add another constraint to the table. This time we make sure that everyone has a few words in their bio. If the user has a too short bio, we are appending a random string.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION random_bio(integer)
    RETURNS TEXT AS
    $BODY$
        SELECT array_to_string(
            ARRAY (
                SELECT substring(
                    'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
                    FROM (ceil(random()*26))::int FOR 1
                )
                FROM generate_series(1, $1)
            ),
            ''
)
$BODY$
LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE;
```

Then we can call this function from the `up` migration:
* if `bio` is null, we add a constant `'this employee did not provide a bio'`
* if `bio` is shorter than 15 characters, we generate random characters to reach 15 characters using the function `random_bio`
* if `bio` is longer than 100 characters, we truncate `bio` and add `...` to the end

The complete migration is the following:

```yaml
operations:
 - create_constraint:
    name: limited_required_bio
    table: employee
    type: check
    columns:
     - bio
    check: length(bio) > 15 AND length(bio) < 100
    up:
     bio: >
       CASE
         WHEN bio IS NULL THEN 'this employee did not provide a bio'
         WHEN length(bio) <= 15 THEN bio || SELECT random_bio(16-length(bio))
         WHEN length(bio) >= 100 THEN left(bio, 96) || '...'
         ELSE bio
       END
    down:
     bio: bio
```

The `bio` column for `Alice` now contains extra 5 characters (`aoivgz`) after the migration is complete:

```
 name  | nick |     email       | salary |                 bio
-------+------+-----------------+--------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com  |   5000 | hi, i am aloivgd
 Bob   | rob  | rob@company.com |   5400 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  | cat@company.com |   6500 | this employee did not provide a bio
```
